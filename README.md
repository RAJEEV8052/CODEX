## Project Introduction: AI-Powered Code Reviewer 🤖

This project is an **AI-powered code reviewer** application that I developed using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). My goal with this project was to create a practical tool that leverages artificial intelligence to help developers write cleaner, more efficient code. 🚀

At its core, this application allows users to input their code, which is then sent to a backend server. This server communicates with an advanced AI model (specifically, Google's Gemini ✨) to analyze the code for potential errors, suggest improvements, and identify best practices. The AI's comprehensive review is then sent back to the server and displayed intuitively on the frontend for the user. 💡

I built this project from the ground up, handling both the backend development (API creation, server logic, and AI model integration) and the frontend user interface. This involved ensuring seamless communication between all components to deliver a robust and effective code review experience. 🛠️ This project showcases my skills in full-stack development and my ability to integrate powerful AI capabilities into a real-world application. 🌟
